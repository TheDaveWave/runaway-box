# Runaway Box
Try to make an html element move away from your cursor.

## Description

A web application to serve as a prototype for making an element move from your cursor. Started out as a joke but I find that it helps to learn and explore more vanilla Javascript and how it interfaces with the html DOM.
Each iteration makes it more simplified and dynamic.
